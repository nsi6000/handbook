## Study Tips and Tricks
### Top 5 tips:
- **[Active Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect) / Test yourself / Quizz yourself** :
    - Use **[flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard)**.
        - Try the free and open source software **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)** ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)) [Getting Started](https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html)).
        - Use AI (e.g. ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Microsoft Bing Copilot) to generate flashcards (double-check its correctness before studying it).
        - Use the [Leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system).
    - **Teach / ELI5** (Explain me Like I'm 5 years old, i.e. explain concepts with simple words.) (concepts).
    - **[Rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)**.
    - Practice past/old exams/tests/papers/quizzes.
    - Practice mock/practice exams/tests/papers/quizzes/exercises/questions/problems. (often found in textbooks, on the internet or given by the professor. Use Questions Banks ("QBanks")).)
    - Make your own questions and answers (Q&A / FAQ).
        - Use AI (e.g. ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Microsoft Bing Copilot) to generate questions and answers (double-check its correctness before studying it).
    - Find [workbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workbook), [problem books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_book) or solution books.
- **Consistency** :
    - Study early (in the semester/year), study often (daily).
    - Build the habit of studying. Studying one hour everyday day for a week beats studying 7 hours in one day that week. 
- **Good sleep** :
    - Avoid cramming and all-nighters.
- **Avoid distractions / Go offline** : no phones (social medias), no laptops, no tablets,...
- **Retro-Planning** :
    - Start planning your study from the day of the exam and go backwards until today.
    - Here is how to retro-plan effectively in practice:
        - First, write down your exam dates (your deadlines).
        - Then, schedule minimum 8 hours of sleep per day.
        - Then, schedule your lunch time.
        - Then, schedule your time for exercise/sports.
        - And finally, schedule your study time by topic/subject in 1 or 2 hours blocks, mixing the topics/subjects (see interleaving).
### Other tips:
- Have a quiet and tidy study space/desk.
- Use **[Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)**:
    - To fight the [Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).
    - Use a Spaced Repition Sheet: Use a papersheet or a digital spreasheet, one per exam, and make the following 8 columns in a table:
        - Topic/Subject: the name of the topic/subject you are going to study;
        - 0-DAY: the date of the day you start studying the topic/subject for the first time;
        - 1-DAY: the day after 0-DAY;
        - 3-DAYS: three days after 0-DAY;
        - 1-WEEK: one week after 0-DAY;
        - 3-WEEKS: three weeks after 0-DAY;
        - 1-MONTH: one month after 0-DAY;
        - PRE-EXAM: days just before the exam date;
    - Use different colors to highlight each cell based on how well the study session went (using highlighters or colored pencils if paper-based). (e.g. Green-colored: the session went well, Orange-colored: you need more practice, Red-colored: the session was very hard.)
- **Interleaving** : mix-and-match topics/subjects/questions/flashcards.
- **Blurting / Braindumping** : start from a blank page and write down everything you know about a topic/concept.
- **[Progressive Overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload)** : start small and easy, then progressively increase the workload and the difficulty.
- [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) : a simple study routine beats a complex one.
- Set deadlines (in your planning) and fixed time slots (1 hour or 2 hours):

- Enjoy the process of studying and make it enjoyable. (favorite drink/snacks, light music, personal reward,...)
- **Upsolving** :
    - The process of solving questions/problems slightly harder than your current level.

- **Disaggregate concepts** :
    - Split/break down concepts into smaller ones.

            - Outline early, outline often. Start your outline early in the semester and improve/refine regularly/frequently (Reduce the length of your outline as much as possible.).
            - Make your **own** outline. The process of making an outline helps you memorizing its content.
            - Ideal length: 3-6 pages for an Attack Outline. 20-30 pages for a Regular Outline.
            - Begin outlining aroung the Syllabus of the course and/or with the Table of Contents of your reference tectbook/casebook. Then fill-in your outline based on your class notes and/or commercial outlines and/or other students' outlines.
            - Use Flowcharts, Comparison Tables, Pictures, and Drawings as much as possible.
            - Compare your outline with old student's outlines.
            - For Law Students: structure your outline around the **rules**, and not the cases.
    - Include learning objectives;
    - Include an [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(publishing)) with core concepts;
    - Include personal tips and tricks about the topic/subject;
    - Include acronyms and mnemonics,
    - Include interesting questions and answers,
    - Include personal insights.
- **Synthetize, don't summarize** :
    - Focus on insights, do not just reduce the size of the text.
- **Reframe your mindset** :
    - Convince yourself that every test/exam is aceable.
- Find a study buddy or join a study group.
- Use the [Cornell Notetaking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes).
- Use the [SQ3R method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R).
- Check the [Study Skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_skills) and [Learning methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Learning_methods) Wikipedia pages for more techniques.

## Study methods to avoid
- Re-reading your notes or your textbook.
- Re-writing your notes or your textbook.
- Highlighting/Circling/Underlining your notes or your textbook.
- The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) : take breaks when you feel like it instead.
